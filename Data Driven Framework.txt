Data-Driven Framework: In data-driven frameworks,
 test data is separated from test scripts and 
 stored in an external resource such as text file,
 excel spreadsheet, CSV file or database table.
 
  In keyword driven frameworks, the test logic is divided into keywords and functions. A sequence of keywords
  is used to define the test scripts and these keywords are further defined as functions to implement the desired behaviour.
  
  Testlink,TestRail,Jira is used to write test cases.
